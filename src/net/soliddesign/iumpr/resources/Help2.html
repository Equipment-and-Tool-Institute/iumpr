<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The IUMPR Data Collection Tool allows manufacturers to
automate
analysis of on-board data as the test vehicle is driven to verify
that the subjected monitors are running on the road, and that the
vehicle software is appropriately updating the relevant data
parameters. This provides for consistent and uniform testing among
the heavy-duty engine manufacturers and provides a standardized
report format for review by California Air Resources Board (ARB)
staff.</p>
<h1>Operation</h1>
<h2 class="western">Program Initiation</h2>
<p>Users should navigate to the location of the
executable&nbsp;IUMPR Data Collection Tool or
shortcut
and double-click the file icon to launch the&nbsp;application. Upon
launch, the main screen is presented with “Select
Vehicle Adapter” displayed in the progress bar (middle of window, below
buttons and just above
blank report area of main screen). The main screen will be
used to select the vehicle communications adapter, select or create
the report file, and control the operation of the tool.</p>
<br>

<br clear="all">
<h2>Selecting a Vehicle Adapter
</h2>
<p>The user must select a vehicle communications adapter before
any
other actions are possible. The Select Vehicle Adapter drop down will
be populated based upon the vehicle adapters installed on the
computer. If there are no vehicle adapters installed, the user will
need to install them and restart the application. [Note that
the&nbsp;Vehicle
Adapter drop down list of the&nbsp;IUMPR Data Collection Tool
<span style="font-weight: bold;">PROTOTYPE</span>
is populated with dummy adapters used for demonstration purposes only.
&nbsp;This is only for the <span style="font-weight: bold;">PROTOTYPE</span>!]
&nbsp;After a vehicle
adapter is selected the user can then select or create a report file.</p>
<h2 class="western">Selecting/Creating a Report File</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The report file can be
selected or
created after a vehicle adapter has been selected. Pushing the
"Select File..." button will open a file chooser dialog.
The file chooser dialog will allow the user to navigate to the
desired report file directory. The user may type the name of the file
to be used (creating a new&nbsp;file if it does not exist)
or&nbsp;select an existing file.&nbsp;If the specified filename
does
not have the
extension ".iumpr," it will be added to the filename by
the application.</p>
<p>If the user would like to recover previously saved
data, they must select an existing file. &nbsp;Report files are
stored
in plaintext format allowing a user
to examine contents for VIN, calibration data, time stamp data,
etc. Upon
selecting an existing file it will
be validated to ensure it's suitable for use.&nbsp;If the the
previous
VIN and Calibration Information found in the file are inconsistent, the
user
will not be able to proceed. Time Stamps in an existing report file
must monotonically increase. (Subsequent time stamps must increase or
match preceding time stamp.) If the file is not suitable for use, the
user will be required to choose a different report file or close the
application.<br>
<br>
If there is a problem reading the file or the application cannot write
to the file, a pop up will be presented and the user will be required
to
choose a different report file or close the application.</p>
<h2 class="western">Reading Vehicle Information</h2>
<p>After a vehicle adapter has been
selected and a valid report file chosen, the “Read Vehicle
Info” button will be enabled allowing the user to read VIN,
Calibrations, and Time Since Code Clear information from the vehicle.
VIN and Calibrations information will be displayed in the “VIN:”
and “Cals:” areas of the main screen respectively. If an existing
report file has been selected, VIN, Calibrations, and Time Since Code
Clear from the vehicle will be checked against the corresponding
information in the selected report file. If the VIN or
Calibrations do not match, the user will be required to chose a
different vehicle or report file to continue. After choosing a new
report file or different vehicle, the application will require the user
to read
the vehicle information again before proceeding.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the last Time Since Code
Clear in the file will be checked against the current Time Since
Code Clear from the vehicle. If the Time Since Code Clear was
reset or there is a gap of more than 60 minutes,&nbsp;a warning
message will be displayed, but the user will be allowed to continue.<br>
<br>
Once it has been determined that the vehicle information matches a
valid report file, the user will be able to Generate the Vehicle Data
Plate. The Generate Vehicle Data Plate button will be enabled and the
application will display “Push Generate Vehicle Data Plate
Button” in the progress bar. If for any reason, the user does
not want to continue with the selected adapter, report file, or
vehicle, these can be changed prior to pushing the Generate Vehicle
Data Plate button.</p>

<h2>Generating Vehicle Data Plate</h2>
After the vehicle
information has been
read and it's been determined that the report file matches the
connected vehicle, the user may Generate the Vehicle Data Plate by
pushing the "Generate Vehicle Data Plate" button. The Tool
will query the vehicle and return information to the Report Area at
the bottom of the tool. The information appearing in the Report Area
will also be appended to the report file.
<p>Status information
on the data collection process and work in progress is provided in the
progress bar just
above the Report Area. At any time during the vehicle data plate
generation, the user may press the "Stop" button. If the
"Stop" button is pressed, the data plate generation will
stop and a message will be recorded to the file indicating the
operation was stopped. The user will be able to press the Generate
Vehicle Data Plate button again but will be unable to select a
different adapter or report file. Until the vehicle data plate has
been successfully generated the user
will not able to proceed to any other functions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the vehicle data plate
generation, if a new file is being used, the Diagnostic Trouble Codes
(DTCs) will be cleared. Also, for new or existing files, the emission
related DTCs will be read. If there are DTCs present, a warning
dialog will be presented to the user. The user then has the choice to
continue using the tool or end the program by pushing the “Stop”
button.<br>
<br>
The application indicates the successful completion of Vehicle Data
Plate generation by showing “Data Plate
Report Completed” on the progress bar and enabling the&nbsp;"Track
Monitor Completion Status”
and “Collect Tests Results” buttons.
After the vehicle data plate has been generated, the user will not
be able to generate additional data plates, select a different
adapter or report file, or read information from the vehicle until the
application has been restarted.</p>
<h2 class="western">Tracking Monitor Completion Status</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">After the Vehicle Data
Plate has been
generated, the user may track the monitor completion status by
pressing the "Track Monitor Completion Status" button.
After pressing this button a Status View will&nbsp;open as a separate
window showing the Performance Ratios and Vehicle Monitors. &nbsp;While
executing the Tracking Monitor Completion Status function, the
application will compare current DM20 monitor data to the DM20 monitor
Baseline data from the first Vehicle Data Plate in the report file. <br></p>
<br>
The
Performance Ratio Table of the Status View displays the current
Performance Ratios from the DM20 packets.&nbsp; Field
background
colors are used to indicate&nbsp;changes from Baseline data.&nbsp; Row
color
changes indicate changes during this session &nbsp;More details are
provided in the Performance Ratio Table section below.
<p>Monitor Completion Status tracking will continue
indefinitely while the vehicle continues to communicate or until the
user presses the "Stop" button on the main screen or "Stop
Tracking Monitor Completion Status" button on the Status View
window. It's important to note the different actions produced by these
two different stop buttons. &nbsp;Pressing the "Stop"
button on the main screen will interrupt the operation immediately
without completing the Track Monitor Completion Status
operation.
Pressing the "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status"
button on the Status View will allow the application to read additional
information from
the vehicle and complete the Tracking Monitor Completion Status
operation. The Status View window can only be closed by pressing the
"Stop" button (on main screen) or the "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion
Status" button (on Status View window).<br>
<br>
If the vehicle stops providing engine speed, DM5, DM20, or DM26
the operation will end. (Details are provided in the “Communications
Status” section below.) If this happens, the results will be summarized
and the
Status View will be closed. At that time the user may track the
monitors again or Collect Tests Results.</p>
<h3 class="western">Status View</h3>
<p>The Status View window is opened while the tool is tracking
monitor
completion status to provide useful information about the monitor
tracking progress.
It is composed of an “Information Table,” a “Performance
Ratio Table,” “Vehicle Monitors Table,” a “Stop
Tracking Monitor Completion Status Button,” and “Communications
Status” section.</p>
<br>
<img src="Help1_html_ae3be7305b3d9ae7.jpg" name="Image3" align="left" border="0" height="551" width="893">
<br clear="all">
<h4 class="western">Information Table (Name – Value –
Unit)</h4>
<p>The Information Table at the top shows
the Time and Distance since DTCs were cleared information from DM21 packets.
It also displays the number of Ignition Cycles and OBD Monitoring
Conditions Encountered from DM20 packets. If a value changes in a
positive direction, the row will be colored green. If the value goes
backwards, the row will be colored red.<br>
<br>
The user can sort the table by clicking on the column headings.</p>
<h4 class="western">Performance Ratio Table (Source –
Monitor
from DM20 – Numerator – Denominator)</h4>
While
executing the Tracking Monitor Completion Status function, the
application will compare current DM20 monitor data to the DM20 monitor
Baseline data from the first Vehicle Data Plate in the report file. <br>
<br>
The
Performance Ratio Table of the Status View displays the current
Performance Ratios from DM20 packets.&nbsp; Field
background
colors indicate a Numerator&nbsp;change relative&nbsp;to the
Baseline
data (first Vehicle Data Plate of report file).&nbsp; If a value
has
changed in a positive direction, the field will be colored green. If
the value has changed in a negative direction, the field will be
colored red.<br>
<br>
If a change to a Numerator is observed while the
application is executing the Tracking Monitor Completion Status
function, the entire row will be highlighted in green (positive change)
or red (negative change). &nbsp;
<p>The user can sort the table by clicking on the column headings.
By
default the column will sort ratios by source, then by ratio name.</p>
<h4 class="western">Vehicle Monitors Table (Vehicle
Monitors –
Trip Status (DM26) – Overall Status (DM5))</h4>
<p>The Vehicle Monitors Table shows the composite vehicle
monitors
status. It shows the Trip Status from DM26 packets, and the Overall
Status from DM5 packets. Monitors that are not supported or monitored
are colored red. Monitors that are not complete will be the
background color. Monitors that are complete are colored green.</p>
<h4 class="western">Stop Tracking Monitor Completion
Status Button
(bottom left)</h4>
<p>The "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status" button
should be used to end the tracking process.
Pushing this button will allow the process to gather the remaining
information and summarize the differences in the ratios and monitors.
&nbsp;The "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status" button will
also
close the Status View. &nbsp;After pressing this button, the
application will show the progress through the final steps of the
Tracking Monitor Completion Status function in the progress bar of the
main screen.</p>
<h4 class="western">Communication Status (bottom right)</h4>
<p>The communication status of the DM5, DM20, DM26, and DM21
packets
are displayed to provide an indication of communication status. When
a packet is received, the value in the progress bar of the appropriate
packet is set to the
maximum. As time passes, the value slowly decreases. If the value
reaches zero, "Timeout" will be displayed. When a packet is
received again, the value will return to the maximum and the process
will continue. A communication status check is done every 10 seconds. For DM5 requests the
application will try three times. &nbsp;Engine speed is checked every 300
ms. If there is no response for either, the data collection will
abort.</p>
<h2 class="western">Collecting Tests Results</h2>
<p>Once the Vehicle Data Plate has been generated, the user may
collect the tests results by pressing the "Collect Tests
Results" button. This process will query the vehicle with a DM24 message to
determine which SPNs support tests results. &nbsp;For those
supported
SPNs, a DM7 will be sent. &nbsp;The results will be written to the
report file and Report Area. Work in progress and status information
on the collect test results process is provided in the progress bar
just
above the Report Area. When the process is complete, the application
wll display "Data Collection Log Completed" in the progress bar and an END
OF REPORT banner will be written to the Report Area and report file.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any time during the collecting test results process, the
user may press the "Stop" button. Pressing the
"Stop" button will
stop the process and cause&nbsp;a data collection log stopped
message to be recorded to the Report Area and report file. &nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="western">Closing the Application</h2>
<p>The user&nbsp;closes the application by pressing the "X"
in upper right corner of the title bar. If a report file has been selected, a message will
be written to the file indicating when the application was closed.</p>
