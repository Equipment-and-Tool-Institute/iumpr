	</h1>
	<p>The IUMPR Data Collection Tool provides for the automated collection of data required by 13 CCR
		1971.1 (l)(2.3.3), while producing a standardized report format for the submission of the data for review by California
		Air Resources Board (CARB) staff. One key feature of this process is the tracking for data collection as the test
		vehicle is driven to identify when the subject monitors have completed and incremented their respective numerators and
		denominators. The Data Collection Tool's automated collection of In Use Monitor Performance Ratios [IUMPR], test
		results, and quality checks provide for consistent reporting among the heavy-duty engine manufacturers.</p>
	
	<p>The HD OBD IUMPR Data Collection Tool and process is memorialized in [draft] SAE J3162&trade;.  This help file links the software and its process back to SAE J3162.  Thus, the software and process have been given an industry standard reference that will provide for clear communication among Engine Manufacturers and CARB staff.  
13 CCR (l)(2.3.3) States:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<i>(l)(2.3.3) The evaluation shall verify that the software used to track the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining in-use monitoring frequency correctly increments as required in section (d)(4).</i>
	</blockquote>

	<h2>
		<a name="1.1_IUMPR_Data_Collection_Tool_Overview"></a>1.1 IUMPR Data Collection Tool Overview
	</h2>
	<p>The IUMPR Data Collection Tool is used for HD vehicles that comply with US EPA and CARB data communications
		regulations using the SAE J1939&trade; family of standards. The purpose of the tool is the collection and summary of vehicle
		telemetry for test results, monitor ratios, and monitor completion. The collected data and summaries are then
		automatically reported creating a standardized format for the submission of (l)(2.3.3) data to CARB.</p>
	<p>
		The software consists of 4 principle functions. These functions may be run in sequence during each use of the
		software. But the functions are implemented so that they may be run in alternate orders that are best suited to the
		driving demonstration cycles planned for the monitor entry conditions of individual tests.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>The last report contained in any tool output file to be provided to CARB shall be the report from Function E
			(Collect Test Results). The first report in any tool output file shall be the report from Function B (Generate
			Vehicle Data Plate).</i>
	</p>
	<h3>Sequence of Steps</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none">
		<li><b>Selecting a Vehicle Adapter (Section 2.3)</b> <br>The software can only be used with a TMC RP 1210C
			adapter. This feature presents the available adapters from which the user must select how he prefers to communicate
			with the vehicle.</li>
		<li><br></li>
		<li><b>Function A. Select/Create a Report File (Section 2.4) and Read Vehicle Information (Section 2.5)</b><br>
			The first principal step is to identify which file shall contain the collected data. If the file already contains
			data, Read Vehicle Information ensures that the same vehicle with the same VIN and CAL IDs is used to append data on
			the end of the file.
		<li><br></li>
		<li><b>Function B. Generate Vehicle Data Plate (Section 2.6)</b> <br>Before the vehicle is driven, the next
			overall step is to document the VIN, CAL IDs and Component IDs for the vehicle. Reuse of this function for data
			collection over multiple days allows the user to visually assess the status of the vehicle before it is driven. This
			report must be the first report in any submitted file.</li>
		<li><br></li>
		<li><b>Function C. Track Monitor Completion Status (Section 2.7)</b><br> This function is selected while the
			vehicle is driven to match the monitor entry conditions of individual tests. When all the tests for a particular
			monitor are completed, the status of the monitor will change from not complete to complete and the numerator and
			denominator will increment. The background for the monitor will then turn green. The monitor/test entry conditions
			are defined by the engine manufacturer and are not included in the tool as instructions to the user. See sections 1.3
			and 1.4 for more information.</li>
		<li><br></li>
		<li><b>Function E. Collect Tests Results (Section 2.8)</b><br> When there is sufficient change in the
			monitor status, that is after the desired number of monitors are now highlighted in green. Collect test results
			queries and documents the test data (value, minimum and maximum) for all the tests supported by the engine
			manufacturer's HD OBD system. It also repeats the comparison if the resulting monitor status with the initial monitor
			status. This report must be the last report in any submitted file.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Alternate Sequence of Steps</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type: none">
		<li>&nbsp;1. Connect the communications adapter to the vehicle's diagnostic port and open the IUMPR tool.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;2. Select the appropriate vehicle adapter from the dropdown.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;3. Click "Select File" button to create or select an existing report file.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;4. Click "Read Vehicle Info".</li>
		<li>&nbsp;5. Click "Generate Vehicle Data Plate".</li>
		<li>&nbsp;6. Click "Collect Test Results". All the test results will be incomplete. Following the completion of a
			function, an option exists to stay connected to the truck or not.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;7. Click "Track Monitor Completion Status".</li>
		<li>&nbsp;8. Drive the truck for the required operating cycles for the desired monitors to complete.</li>
		<li>&nbsp;9. Click on "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status".</li>
		<li>10. Click "Collect Test Results". All the test results for the completed monitors will show values and
			limits.</li>
		<li>11. All the results are stored in a single log file with the *.iumpr extension.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Section 2 provides a step by step instruction on the use of these functions. The balance of section 1 describes
		hardware and software requirements, vehicle preparation and data collection notes. Please note that the tool clears HD
		OBD emissions faults using DM11 every time a new file is created. Key On Engine Off operation is strongly recommended
		for the Vehicle Data Plate which provides the clear faults query before data is collected. Incomplete clearing of data
		in response to the DM11 command will likely render the test results unacceptable for submission to CARB.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>
		<a name="1.2_Hardware_and_Software_Required"></a>1.2 Hardware and Software Required
	</h2>
	<p>The tool is designed for use on Windows 7 - Windows 10 PCs with ATA/TMC RP 1210C Adapters for datalink
		communications of SAE J1939 messages. The application software is self-contained; no additional runtime libraries are
		required. Use on PCs with less than 512MB of RAM is not recommended. The PC's local file system or directly connected
		flash drive is intended to be used. Note, files created by the tool with the .iumpr file extension contain 8-bit ASCII
		data. These files may be viewed using common PC utility programs by selecting "Open with". CAN data is logged in the
		operating systems %TEMP% directory. Commonly this is %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp". These logs can be useful in
		problem root cause analysis. The operating system will reclaim this disk space, when space is needed. The operating
		systems disk cleanup utility will remove these files.</p>
	<br>

	<h2>
		<a name="1.3_Vehicle_Preparation_Notes"></a>1.3 Vehicle Preparation Notes
	</h2>
	<p>Vehicles that are used for data collection must be fault free with no pending diagnostics codes. The MIL shall
		be off. Inspection of the engine's condition using the engine manufacturer's service tool is recommended. This
		inspection may also clear emissions related and non-emissions related faults before launching the application. The
		engine manufacturer's service tool shall not be used in parallel with the application.</p>
	<p>The tool clears HD OBD emissions faults using DM11 every time a new file is created. Key On Engine Off operation
		is strongly recommended for the Vehicle Data Plate which provides the clear faults query before data is collected.
		Incomplete clearing of data in response to the DM11 command will likely render the test results the test results
		unacceptable to CARB.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>
		<a name="1.4_Data_Collection_Notes"></a>1.4 Data Collection Notes
	</h2>
	<p>The successful completion of data collection depends on a thorough understanding of the manufacturer's monitor
		entry conditions and ARB regulations for incrementing numerators and denominators as defined in 13 CCR 1971.1 (d).
		Operating cycles must be a minimum of ten minutes in length where the engine speed exceeds 1150 RPM for five minutes.
		13 CCR 1971.1 (d)(4.3.2)(G) also defines an 800 minute denominator for NMHC catalyst infrequent regeneration, and (H)
		requires 10 seconds of commanded regeneration.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<i> 13 CCR 1971.1 (d)(4.3.2)(H) For 2013 and subsequent model year engines, in addition to the requirements of
			section (d)(4.3.2)(B) above, the denominator(s) for the following monitors shall be incremented if and only if a
			regeneration event is commanded for a time greater than or equal to 10 seconds: <br> <br> (i) Diesel NMHC
			converting catalyst other aftertreatment assistance functions (sections (e)(5.2.3)(A) and (C))<br> (ii) PM
			filter incomplete regeneration (section (e)(8.2.3)).
		</i>
	</blockquote>
	<br>
	<p>Data collection on a given vehicle may not work due to missing responses when Source Address 249 is used by
		other equipment on the vehicle that pretend to be a service tool -- Devices are not required to process multiple
		requests in parallel. Data collection may also be disrupted when devices on the vehicle do not adhere to message
		protocols described in the SAE J1939 recommended practices. Finally, vehicles with very high bus loading may exceed
		the capacity of the adapter, causing messages to become lost.</p>

	<p>The user must select a vehicle communications adapter before any other actions are possible. The Select Vehicle
		Adapter drop down list guides the selection of an installed communications adapter that will be used for J1939
		datalink communications with the engine. This list will be populated with all of the TMC RP1210C adapters installed on
		the computer. The user may pick one adapter from the drop down list. If there are no vehicle adapters installed, the
		user will need to install them and restart the application. Upon successfully selecting a vehicle adapter, "Select
		Report File" is displayed in the progress bar and the user can then select or create a report file. Once report
		generation has begun, the Select Vehicle Adapter control is disabled until the report generation has completed.</p>
	<p>Follow the adapter manufacturer's recommendations for connecting the adapter to the PC and to the vehicle.
		Adapters are often recommended to be connected to the PC and the vehicle's diagnostic connector before the ignition
		key is turned on. Only the adapter to be used by the data collection tool software should be connected to the
		vehicle's J1939-13 connecter while the application software is in use.</p>

	<p>After a vehicle adapter has been selected, the user can select or create a report file. Pushing the "Select
		File..." button will open a standard Windows file selection dialog box. The file chooser dialog will allow the user to
		navigate to the desired report file directory. The user will be able to choose any file location, whether it is local
		to the computer or a connected network drive. The user may type the name of the file to be used, (The tool creates a
		new file if filename entered does not exist) or select an existing file displayed in the file selection dialog box. If
		the specified filename (new file) does not have the extension ".iumpr," it will be added to the filename by the
		application. If the user chooses the wrong file, they are able to cancel their selection and no file will be selected.
		After they have chosen a file this control will display the path and filename.</p>
	<p>If the user would like to extend previously saved data, they must select an existing file. Selections of
		existing files are validated to ensure their suitability for use. If the previous VIN and Calibration Information
		found in the file are inconsistent within the selected file, the user cannot proceed with that file. Time Stamps in an
		existing report file must also monotonically increase. (Subsequent time stamps must increase or match preceding time
		stamp.) If the file is not suitable for use, the user must choose a different report file or close the application.
		Report files are stored in plaintext format allowing a user to examine contents for VIN, calibration data, time stamp
		data, etc.</p>
	<p>If there is a problem reading the file or the application cannot write to the file, a pop up will be presented
		and the user will be required to choose a different report file or close the application. After successfully selecting

	<br>
	<p>After a vehicle adapter has been selected and a valid report file specified, the "Read Vehicle Info" button is
		enabled, allowing the user to read VIN, Calibrations, and Time Since Code Clear information from the vehicle. VIN and
		Engine Calibrations information will be displayed in the "VIN:" and "Cal ID" areas respectively. If an existing report
		file has been selected, VIN, Calibrations, and Time Since Code Clear from the vehicle will be checked against the
		corresponding information in the selected report file. Additionally, the last Time Since Code Clear in the file will
		be checked against the current Time Since Code Clear from the vehicle. If the Time Since Code Clear was reset or there
		is a gap of more than 60 minutes, a warning message will be displayed, but the user will be allowed to continue using

	<p>Important: During the vehicle data plate generation, if a new file is being used, the Diagnostic Trouble Codes
		(DTCs) will be cleared, using the SAE J1939-73 DM11 query. Many manufacturers only honor a DM11 query when the engine
		isn't running. If a running engine is observed, a warning dialogue will open cautioning the user to stop the engine
		and turn the key back on, before continuing with the data plate generation. Also, for new or existing files, the
		emission related DTCs will be read. If there are DTCs present, a warning dialog will be presented to the user. The
		user then has the choice to continue using the tool or end the program by pushing the "Stop"" button.</p>
	<p>Status information on the data collection process and work in progress is provided in the progress bar just
		above the Report Logger area. At any time during the vehicle data plate generation, the user may press the "Stop"
		button. If the "Stop" button is pressed, the data plate generation will stop and a message will be recorded to the
		file indicating the operation was stopped. The user will be able to press the "Generate Vehicle Data Plate" button
		again but will be unable to select a different adapter or report file. Until the vehicle data plate has been
		successfully generated the user will not be able to proceed to any other function.</p>
	<p>The application indicates the successful completion of Vehicle Data Plate generation by showing "Data Plate
		Report Completed" on the progress bar and enabling the "Track Monitor Completion Status" and "Collect Tests Results"
		buttons. After the vehicle data plate has been generated, the user will not be able to generate additional data
		plates, select a different adapter or report file, or read information from the vehicle until the application has been

		will be displayed indicating that communications has failed. (If this occurs, user should check for loose adapter
		cable or vehicle off condition.) When a message is received, the value will return to the maximum and the process will
		continue. A communication status check is done every 10 seconds. For DM5 requests the application will try three
		times. Engine speed is checked every 300 ms. If there is no response for either, the data collection will abort.</p>

	<h3>Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status Button (bottom left)</h3>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align: center">
		<img style="width: 762px; height: 168px;" alt="Stop Button" src="Help2_Capture008.JPG">
		<h4>Stop Button</h4>
	</div>
	<p>The "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status" button should be used to end the tracking process. After pressing
		this button, the application will display the progress through the final steps of the Tracking Monitor Completion
		Status function in the progress bar and Report Logger of the main screen (DM21 Time Since Code Cleared, Vehicle
		Distance, and Engine Hours). And, the process will gather the remaining information and summarize the differences in
		the ratios and monitors. The "Stop Tracking Monitor Completion Status" button will also close the Status View.</p>
	<p>Once the Status View has been closed, users are returned to the main screen. The progress bar says "Data Monitor
		Log Completed." Here they have the option of continuing to track monitors (by hitting the "Track Monitor Completion
		Status" button), collecting test results (by hitting the "Collect Tests Results" button), or exiting the application
		(by hitting the "Stop" button and pressing the "X" in upper right corner of the title bar) from the main screen.</p>

	</h2>
	<p>Once the Vehicle Data Plate has been generated, the user may collect the tests results by pressing the "Collect
		Tests Results" button. This process will query the vehicle with a DM24 message to determine which SPNs support tests
		results. For those supported SPNs, a DM7 will be sent. The results will be written to the report file and Report
		Logger area. Work in progress and status information on the Collect Test Results process is provided in the progress
		bar just above the Report Logger. When the process is complete, the application will display "Data Collection Log
		Completed" in the progress bar and an END OF REPORT banner will be written to the Report Logger area and report file.</p>
	<p>At any time during the Collect Test Results process, the user may press the "Stop" button. Pressing the "Stop"
		button will stop the process and cause a data collection log stopped message to be recorded to the Report Logger area
		and report file.</p>
